# Introduction

Our final project explores the long-term trends and interrelationships between key development indicators across countries using data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) database. Specifically, we focus on life expectancy, fertility rate, population growth, and
school enrollment. These indicators are foundational in understanding the social and demographic evolution of countries from 1960 to 2023.

By analyzing these indicators longitudinally, we aim to reveal how population health, demographic transition, and education investment interact over time, and how they can collectively inform national and global development strategies.

## Background

Development indicators are critical tools for understanding how
societies progress over time. Measures such as life expectancy and
fertility rate reveal how access to healthcare, education, and economic
opportunities impact the quality of life and long-term population
dynamics. In contrast, metrics like school enrollment and population
growth highlight the importance of human capital and demographic
pressure in shaping a country’s future trajectory.

Longitudinal data allows us to move beyond snapshots and instead capture
how these dynamics unfold over decades. For example, countries with
declining fertility and increasing school enrollment often exhibit
longer life expectancies, but this relationship may vary depending on
region, income level, or development stage.

The World Development Indicators (WDI) database provides extensive
historical data on these themes, making it an ideal resource for
studying global development trends over time. Our project leverages this
resource to analyze patterns from 1960 through 2023 across over 100
countries.

## Research Questions

Our project addresses the following questions:

1.  How has life expectancy evolved globally since 1960, and how is it
    associated with fertility and education trends?\
2.  What is the relationship between school enrollment and fertility
    rate across countries?\
3.  Do countries with rapid population growth face distinct development
    challenges in terms of life expectancy?\
4.  What insights can we derive from multivariable regression models
    that predict life expectancy using demographic and education
    indicators?

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

-   Analyze long-term trends in life expectancy, fertility, population
    growth, and school enrollment using WDI data.\
-   Examine correlations among these indicators to understand global
    development patterns.\
-   Use regression models to investigate how these factors jointly
    predict life expectancy.\
-   Visualize global development trajectories using intuitive and
    informative charts.

## Data and Methods

This project uses four key indicators from the WDI:

-   **Life Expectancy at Birth (years)** — `SP.DYN.LE00.IN`\
-   **Fertility Rate (births per woman)** — `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`\
-   **Population Growth (annual %)** — `SP.POP.GROW`\
-   **School Enrollment, Primary (% gross)** — `SE.PRM.ENRR`

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# Load and clean data
df = pd.read_csv("datasets/wdi_data.csv")
df = df[df["Country Name"].notna()]
year_cols = [col for col in df.columns if "YR" in col]

df_long = df.melt(
    id_vars=["Country Name", "Country Code", "Series Name", "Series Code"],
    value_vars=year_cols,
    var_name="Year", value_name="Value"
)

df_long["Year"] = df_long["Year"].str.extract(r"(\d{4})")
df_long = df_long[df_long["Year"].notna()]
df_long["Year"] = df_long["Year"].astype(int)


df_long = df_long[df_long["Value"].notna() & (df_long["Value"] != "..")]

df_wide = df_long.pivot(
    index=["Country Name", "Country Code", "Year"],
    columns="Series Name",
    values="Value"
).reset_index()

df_wide = df_wide.rename(columns={
    "Life expectancy at birth, total (years)": "LifeExpectancy",
    "Fertility rate, total (births per woman)": "FertilityRate",
    "Population growth (annual %)": "PopGrowth",
    "School enrollment, primary (% gross)": "PrimaryEnrollGross"
})

for col in ["LifeExpectancy", "FertilityRate", "PopGrowth", "PrimaryEnrollGross"]:
    df_wide[col] = pd.to_numeric(df_wide[col], errors="coerce")
```

## Summary Statistics

```{python}
df_wide[["LifeExpectancy", "FertilityRate", "PopGrowth", "PrimaryEnrollGross"]].describe()
```

These summary statistics help us understand the general range and
variability of the four indicators across time and space. Life
expectancy shows a wide range across countries, from below 50 years to
over 80. Fertility rate and population growth also exhibit significant
variance, reflecting different stages of demographic transition.

## Visualization: Life Expectancy Over Time

```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
selected = ["United States", "India", "China", "Nigeria"]
for country in selected:
    sns.lineplot(
        data=df_wide[df_wide["Country Name"] == country],
        x="Year", y="LifeExpectancy", label=country
    )
plt.title("Life Expectancy Over Time (1960–2023)")
plt.ylabel("Life Expectancy (Years)")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This chart clearly shows the upward trajectory of life expectancy across
all selected countries, albeit with different starting points and rates
of change.

## Exploring Relationships Between Indicators

We now use a pairplot to explore the relationships among the four
indicators:

```{python}
sns.pairplot(
    df_wide[["LifeExpectancy", "FertilityRate", "PopGrowth", "PrimaryEnrollGross"]].dropna()
)
```

This plot reveals a strong negative correlation between life expectancy
and fertility, and a weak positive association between life expectancy
and school enrollment.

# Regression Analysis

We build a linear regression model to predict life expectancy using
fertility, population growth, and school enrollment:

```{python}
ols_model = smf.ols(
    "LifeExpectancy ~ FertilityRate + PopGrowth + PrimaryEnrollGross",
    data=df_wide
).fit()
ols_model.summary()
```

Interpretation Fertility Rate shows a strong negative association with
life expectancy, suggesting that lower fertility correlates with longer
lives.

School Enrollment has a modest positive effect on life expectancy,
highlighting the role of education in improving population health.

Population Growth shows mixed or negligible influence, depending on
regional factors.

## Additional Insights: Country Group Analysis

We can group countries by income level or region (if data permits) to
further refine our analysis. For now, we use a simple example of
comparing high vs low fertility countries:

```{python}
df_wide["FertilityGroup"] = pd.qcut(
    df_wide["FertilityRate"],
    q=2,
    labels=["Low", "High"]
)

sns.boxplot(data=df_wide, x="FertilityGroup", y="LifeExpectancy")
plt.title("Life Expectancy by Fertility Group")
plt.xlabel("Fertility Rate Group")
plt.ylabel("Life Expectancy")
plt.show()
```

The boxplot clearly shows that countries with lower fertility tend to
have higher life expectancy.

## Conclusion

Our analysis shows that demographic and education indicators are deeply
intertwined with population health. Life expectancy has improved
dramatically worldwide since 1960, particularly in countries with
declining fertility and improved school enrollment.

Multivariable regression confirms the strong influence of fertility rate
on life expectancy, with additional positive effects from educational
access. While population growth plays a less clear role, it may be
relevant when considered in combination with economic or geographic
context.

This project reinforces the importance of investing in education and
healthcare to foster long-term development and improve quality of life
globally.
