# Introduction

Our final project explores the long-term trends and interrelationships
between key development indicators across countries using data from the
World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) database. Specifically,
we focus on life expectancy, fertility rate, population growth, and
school enrollment. These indicators are foundational in understanding
the social and demographic evolution of countries from 1960 to 2023.

By analyzing these indicators longitudinally, we aim to reveal how
population health, demographic transition, and education investment
interact over time, and how they can collectively inform national and
global development strategies.

## Background

Development indicators are critical tools for understanding how
societies progress over time. Measures such as life expectancy and
fertility rate reveal how access to healthcare, education, and economic
opportunities impact the quality of life and long-term population
dynamics. In contrast, metrics like school enrollment and population
growth highlight the importance of human capital and demographic
pressure in shaping a country’s future trajectory.

Longitudinal data allows us to move beyond snapshots and instead capture
how these dynamics unfold over decades. For example, countries with
declining fertility and increasing school enrollment often exhibit
longer life expectancies, but this relationship may vary depending on
region, income level, or development stage.

The World Development Indicators (WDI) database provides extensive
historical data on these themes, making it an ideal resource for
studying global development trends over time. Our project leverages this
resource to analyze patterns from 1960 through 2023 across over 100
countries.

## Research Questions

Our project addresses the following questions: 1. How has life
expectancy evolved globally since 1960, and how is it associated with
fertility and education trends? 2. What is the relationship between
school enrollment and fertility rate across countries? 3. Do countries
with rapid population growth face distinct development challenges in
terms of life expectancy? 4. What insights can we derive from
multivariable regression models that predict life expectancy using
demographic and education indicators?

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to: - Analyze long-term
trends in life expectancy, fertility, population growth, and school
enrollment using WDI data. - Examine correlations among these indicators
to understand global development patterns. - Use regression models to
investigate how these factors jointly predict life expectancy. -
Visualize global development trajectories using intuitive and
informative charts.

## Data and Methods

This project uses four key indicators from the WDI: - **Life Expectancy
at Birth (years)** — SP.DYN.LE00.IN - **Fertility Rate (births per
woman)** — SP.DYN.TFRT.IN - **Population Growth (annual %)** —
SP.POP.GROW - **School Enrollment, Primary (% gross)** — SE.PRM.ENRR

The data were cleaned and reshaped from wide to long format, removing
missing values and converting strings to numeric types. The final
dataset includes annual observations from 1960 to 2023 for each country.

We used Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels) for data
manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. A Quarto report
was created to organize the narrative, visual, and quantitative results
in a cohesive document.
